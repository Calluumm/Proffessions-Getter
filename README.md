# Proffessions-Getter
jscript for grabbing prof levels / level percents
queries wynn api for an ingame command to grab a players prof levels for their different character uuids; without more ingame control or more class differentiation on the API the classes can only be
defined by their uuid and type, uuid is likely unrecognisable and type will duplicate but they will be assigned their own numbers, however given the api can change class order and the script is not 
using stored variables the number each class is assigned may not be permanent

colour/format being worked on
